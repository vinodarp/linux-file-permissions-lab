# Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions

## 📝 Project Overview
This project was part of my Cybersecurity course and focuses on exploring essential Linux commands used to navigate directories, read files, and manage file permissions. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with system-level command-line tools that are crucial in cybersecurity operations.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Navigated the Linux file system using commands like `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`
- Viewed file contents with `cat` and `head`
- Managed file permissions using `chmod`, applying permission changes for owner and group
- Practiced restricting access to files by removing read and write rights based on user roles

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Reinforced command-line fluency in Linux
- Understood how to inspect, analyze, and control file access
- Learned how to structure permission changes effectively using `chmod` syntax
