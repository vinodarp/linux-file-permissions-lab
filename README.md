# Linux File Permissions Management

## Project Overview
This project was part of my Cybersecurity coursework and focuses on exploring Linux file system navigation and permission management using command-line tools. Through hands-on exercises, I practiced essential commands used in everyday cybersecurity tasks and learned how permissions impact system security.

## Objectives

- Navigate Linux directory structures using terminal commands.
- Locate and inspect files using tools like `cat` and `head`.
- Understand and apply permission modifications with `chmod`.
- Interpret permission strings using `ls -la`.

## Key Commands Used

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cd`    | Change directories |
| `pwd`   | Show current directory |
| `ls`    | List directory contents |
| `cat`, `head` | Display file content |
| `chmod` | Change file/directory permissions |

## Sample Exercise

```bash
cd /home/analyst/reports/users
cat Q1_added_users.txt
chmod g-r project_m.txt
chmod o-w project_k.txt
ls -la
```

These steps demonstrated how to read user data and restrict group/other access to files.

## Summary

Through this project, I improved my practical knowledge of the Linux operating system. I became more confident with terminal navigation, permission management, and interpreting access controls â€” all essential skills for roles in cybersecurity and systems administration.
